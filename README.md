# Building a Text Summarizer with Deep Learning
As the machine learning lead for Michigan Hackers, I lead a team of advanced students (10 - 12 members) on a natural language processing project, researching deep learning models to generate one-sentence summaries of long text using sequence-to-sequence modeling and recurrent neural networks
